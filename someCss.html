            <p>I actually think it extends beyond just entertainment and fun, I have gave a lot of thought to this and I actually think it can be really really good for you.</p>
            <p>Consider this scenario, your in a clutch situation 1v3 on Dust2 in bombsite B, you just planted the bomb as terrorist and now your CT foes are on-route to your position, you have to make a series of complex decisions without hesitation in order to make the right moves to put you in a winning stance, this super fast prioritising of tasks is something that draws such focus it draws the persons very life force, and you will all know THE WRATH you give someone or someone gives you if interrupted in these hyper focused periods, that is because your so jacked in and we are literally using our minds in a way that they are not used to, this I believe is a good thing and I believe that if approached in a healthy way can be like a gym for the mind.</p>
            <p>There is more evidence emerging regarding such topics, Jane McGonigal has a couple of Ted talks exploring many benefits of gaming in general not even mentioning a super-beast like CSGO, so if gaming is a gym for the mind, then CSGO in my opinion is like Strongman contest based on how difficult the game is.</p>
            <p>Basically says what her belief is, in several decades as gaming becomes more popular and people partake in it more our very minds will stand to benefit, from all the complex mathematical problems we are solving without even really realising it is going to shape our very evolution and for the better.</p>

        <img id="pic" src="2222.jpg" title="CS:GO BAD">

        <div id="p_2">
            <p>First off, I know there's probably going to be a lot of people saying i'm just bad at this game or whatever cliche line. I'll start off by saying: Yes. I am bad at CS. See the bottom part if you want to know why i'm posting this.</p>
            <p>This games recoil mechanic is probably the biggest Achilles heel. I don't understand why the bullets go above the recoil and you basically have to aim at the floor to kill people. I guess this kindof increases the skill ceiling, but its just a shit mechanic. Making your bullets fly meters above where you're aiming makes for a bad game experience.</p>
            <p>Then there's custom games, which me and my other noob friends failed to get into a custom match with just us in it and no bots on a normal map. Either doing what I just described is impossible, (without additional hoops to jump through such as a download) or it is complicated enough that it cannot be easily done by someone who is a noob. Either way, its a shit design. Strike two.</p>
            <p>The last 'big' thing that kills this game for me is the things that make absolutely no sense, like how the supressed M4 has less bullets in a mag while also being more accurate, or how it is impossible to ADS with most weapons in the game. For a game praised so highly for its competitive nature, it is utterly stupid to remove the ability to ADS with most guns when the default firing mechanism is down mostly to RNG. I'm not a pro at this game and I'm not even good but if i was playing for money, it would suck losing a tournament just because I got unlucky with a hipfire. (which I honestly thing CS becoming popular was a complete accident as I dont see how such a shit game can be liked for any other reason than it being popular and good marketing)</p>
